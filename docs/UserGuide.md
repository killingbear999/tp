## **1. Introduction**
Welcome to Cent Wise Dollar Wise User Guide! Cent Wise Dollar Wise is a desktop application for money management, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). This application aims to help NUS hostel students manage their financial situation and track their spending efficiently.
This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the applicationâ€™s installation process and command features.

## **2. Quick Start**
1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest version of `Duke` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F14-2/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to a home folder you would like to use.
4. Open a terminal in that home folder and enter java -jar duke.jar to begin.
5. Type the desired command and press Enter to execute it. Tips: entering help will display the help window with a list of commands that could be executed.

Refer to the [Command Features](#3-command-features) below for details of each command.

## **3. Command Features**
In this section, specific information about each command will be explained. This includes the purpose of each command, and how it is formatted.

Before we begin, do take note of the following information which applies to all commands:
* This application only takes in currencies of SGD, USD and CNY.

* Words in UPPER_CASE are parameters that you should provide.
Example: In `-c CATEGORY`, `CATEGORY` is a parameter. `-c Food` would mean that the item belongs to the 'food' category.

* Parameters in square brackets (i.e. []) are options provided for you to choose to enter (no need to enter [] when entering the command). You may choose one out of all.
Example: `edit INDEX [-c CATEGORY] [-d NEW DESCRIPTION]` can be used as `edit 1 [-c Food]` or `edit 1 [-c NEW DESCRIPTION]`

* The abbreviation of `MONTH` is case sensitive. The system only accepts the abbreviation of `MONTH` with the first three letters, and the first
letter is capitalised. Example: `Jul` for July or `Oct` for October.

* The system has the feature of a currency converter, but it only supports currency conversion for SGD to USD, or USD to SGD, or SGD to CNY, or CNY to SGD.

* The default currency of the system is SGD, but after calling `convert` feature, the default currency will be changed to the currency you have converted to.

* There are 6 main categories of spending items:
    1. Education
    2. Entertainment
    3. Food
    4. Health
    5. Transportation
    6. Utilities

Note: If you categorise an item in a category that is not from these six, the item will be categorised as Others.
