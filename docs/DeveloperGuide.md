![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45732128/97735431-4886f780-1b15-11eb-920c-24e5bf7a76fe.png) <br>

The architecture diagram above explains the high-level design of the application. Given below is a quick overview of each component:

`main`: Initializes spending list at app launch and coordinates the interaction between other components

`data`: Stores the data collected from the user

`storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk

`ui`: Interacts with the user

`command`: Executes the user command or system-issued command

`parser`: Analyzes the user command

**How the Architecture Components Interact with Each Other** <br>

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other when the user issues a general command. <br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45732128/97735507-62c0d580-1b15-11eb-9f14-aab54bf5b29d.png) <br>


### 3.2 UI Component

### 3.3 Parser Component

### 3.4 Command Component
Every command that a user can input into the application is represented by an object that extends the abstract class `Command`. In addition, hidden commands that do not require user inputs also extends from the same abstract class `Command`. `Command` contains some basic methods that are shared by all types of commands, including:
* execute(), which is called after setting up the object appropriately, to perform the action requested by the user; and
* isExit(), which returns a boolean that indicates whether the program should terminate after the command is executed.

The following sections classify the `Command`s into different types based on their functionality within the application.

#### 3.4.1 CLI `Command`s related to Spending List
The following class diagram describes the CLI `Command`s specifically related to the spending list. <br>

### 3.5 Data Component
This component holds the data of the application, including the SpendingList class, Budget class and RepaymentList 
class, in the memory.

#### 3.5.1 SpendingList
The SpendingList class also stores a list of Item objects that the user has spent. The `SpendingList` does not depend on 
Ui, Parser and Storage components. 

Below shows a class diagram how `SpendingList` interacts with other classes. <br>
